# Basil

Basil is an LFS based operating system. It will pretty much follow the LFS Program By The channel "Write your own Operating System" until a some very early things in BLFS. In the future I hope to add some automation scripts in Python, A customised XFCE environment and maybe even its own lightweight shell aimed for linux beginners.

Use at your own risk.

Setup:
  1. Navigate to the project folder.
  2. Use the command "bash lfs.sh".

Current Features:
  * Automatic disk partitioning script.
  * Automated downloading script.
